# domains.viditkhandelwal.com

A simple website which lists all the domains and subdomains of mine that are currently connected to websites.<br>
Made using Bootstrap5.<br>
Used some components and utilities which I had not used a lot before, such as flexbox, sticky container, forms.<br>
Used [formspree.io](https://formspree.io) to collect submissions as I made this website at 1 AM and was too lazy to do server-side stuff for collecting submissions.<br>
Formspree is good because all you need to add into your Bootstrap form is the make sure you write ```method="POST"``` and put the custom URL Formspree gives you in ```action```, something like ```action="https://formspree.io/f/zzzzzzzzz"```
